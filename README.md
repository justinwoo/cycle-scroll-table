# cycle-scroll-table
a scroll table using cycle.js

similar to https://github.com/justinwoo/react-rxjs-scroll and https://github.com/justinwoo/godforsaken-dynamic-width-scroll-table

# time taken for initial commit/version

with zero real knowledge of how cycle.js works, this took me about 6 hours...

1. 1 hour of doing my laundry at my hotel
2. 30 min of going out to a konbini to buy some tea
3. 1 hour of being confused about how to access rendered dom components (clicking through docs)
4. 1 hour of thinking about reading docs but looking at facebook instead
5. 15 min copying webpack configs and modifying them
6. 15 min of looking at RxJS docs again
7. 1 hour of trying to figure out styling
8. remaining time actually coding, lazily skimming the cycle.js docs, and looking at my broken crap

i'll try to write a blog post about this sometime.
